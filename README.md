## SKE Restaurant Project Proposal

1. Title: **SKE Restaurant**

2. Team: Fatalai Jon

3. A menu ordering system for restaurant, including graphical UI.

4. The application lets a restaurant customer (or anyone) choose items to order from a graphical menu of choices, divided into categories.  Categories may be, for example, main dishes, side order, beverages, and dessert.  It is intended to show only a limited selection of food items.  

    The application involves use of objects, collections, graphical UI using JavaFX (if we can learn it well enough), and file I/O.  It is only the end-customer interface and doesn't include interface for sending orders to cook, accounting, or payments.

5. Mockup to be added.
